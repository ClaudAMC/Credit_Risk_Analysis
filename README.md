# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Using the unbalanced LendingClub credit card dataset we looked to evaluate different machine learning models. The models used in this analysis were:
 - RandomOverSampler
 - SMOTE
 - ClusterCentroids
 - SMOTEENN
 - BalancedRandomForestClassifier
 - EasyEnsembleClassifier

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to look at the performance for each model and recommend whether they should ve used to predict credit risk.

## Results

The notebooks where this analysis was performed are listed below:
